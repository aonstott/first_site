        <p id="homep">Hi, my name is Aaron Onstott and I am a student here at BYU.
        I am from California, and this is my first semester at BYU.  Before
        I went to BYU, I did a year at BYU-Idaho which was an <strong>awesome</strong>
        experience. I am very excited to learn more about
        <em>Web Programming!</em></p>
